**this is a development database and should NEVER be used in production for any reason once so ever**


DBA Admin Details:

you may have noticed that the localstorage database committed has been in use for my development, you may also see depending on what you use as ur sqlite viewer
that I use Aqua Data Studio for development, this is because I use RAD Studio Architect Edition, though do not be scared away ANY sq1ite viewer or editor will work..

Good tools:

* JetBrains DataGrip (Paid License)
* Sqlite Viewers
* DBeaver
